## Summary

**Total Problems:** 24  
**Breakdown:**
- Easy: 8 problems
- Medium: 15 problems
- Hard: 1 problem

**Suggested Approach:**
- Do problems in the order listed (easiest patterns first)
- Time allocation:
  - Easy: 20-30 minutes
  - Medium: 30-45 minutes
  - Hard: 45+ minutes
- If stuck after 20 minutes, read the approach (not the code), close it, then implement yourself
- Track which problems you nail vs struggle with for later review
- Re-solve challenging problems after 3-7 days (spaced repetition)

**Duration:** Approximately 2.5 weeks if solving 2-3 problems per day
